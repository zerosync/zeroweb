Zero Web App
=======

## About zeroweb

The Web App doesnâ€™t store any data at all. It acts as interface for browsing, downloading and managing file versions e.g. reverting to an old one. Further it has to implement some kind of user management and provide an administration for it. It would also be nice to administrate the peer to peer behavior e.g. known host. Additional features beyond that could be a music and/or video stream player, a picture gallery or an editor with syntax highlighting.
